# Conditional Statements #
#**Learning objectives**
#
#After this section:
#
# * You will be able to use a simple conditional statement in programming
# * You will know what a Boolean value is
# * You will be able to express conditionals with comparison operators

#|Operator	| Purpose					| Example	|
#|==			| Equal to					| a == b	|
#|!=			| Not equal to				| a != b	|
#|>			| Greater than				| a > b		|
#|>=			| Greater than or equal to	| a >= b	|
#|<			| Less than					| a < b		|
#|<=			| Less than or equal to		| a <= b	|


## Live Demo ##
# if statements
#age = int(input("How old are you? "))
#if age > 17:
#    print("You are of age!")
#    print("Here's a copy of GTA6 for you.")
#print("Next customer, please!")
#
#number = int(input("Please type in a number: "))
#
#if number < 0:
#    print("The number is negative.")
#
#if number > 0:
#    print("The number is positive.")
#
#if number == 0:
#    print("The number is zero.")
#
# Boolean type
#a = 3
#condition = a < 5
#print(condition)
#if condition:
#    print("a is less than 5")
#
#condition = True
#if condition:
#    print("This is printed every time.")
